Output files
============

Here, using the results produced in the :ref:`quickstart` section, we give users a glimpse over the main outputs produced by bacannot. The command used in the quickstart wrote the results under the ``_ANNOTATION`` directory.

.. note::

  Please take note that the pipeline uses the directory set with the ``--output`` parameter as a storage place in which it will create a folder for each sample using its ``id``. Therefore the the same ``--output`` can be used for different annotations.

Directory tree
--------------

After a successful execution, you will have something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Directory tree from the running dir
    .

KEGG KO annotation heatmap
--------------------------

Using both `KofamScan <https://github.com/takaram/kofam_scan>`_ and `KEGGDecoder <https://github.com/bjtully/BioData/tree/master/KEGGDecoder>`_, bacannot is capable of annotating KOs and plotting a heatmap of detected pathways as exemplified below.

Bacannot automatic reports
--------------------------

Bacannot will use `R Markdown <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>`_ to produce automatic annotation reports. To date, the available reports are:

* Report of general annotation features

  - See `the general example report <https://fmalmeida.github.io/reports/report_general.html>`_

* Report of Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes annotation

  - See `the AMR example report <https://fmalmeida.github.io/reports/report_resistance.html>`_

* Report of virulence genes annotation

  - See `the virulence example report <https://fmalmeida.github.io/reports/report_virulence.html>`_

* Report of mobile genetic elements annotation

  - Including plasmids, prophages, ICEs and genomic islands.
  - See `the MGE example report <https://fmalmeida.github.io/reports/report_MGEs.html>`_

* Report of user's custom db annotations.

  - The quickstart does not produce an example, however, the report is similar to the ICEberg section in the MGE example report.
  - See :ref:`custom-db`.

* Report of antiSMASH annotation

  - The annotation report is provided by the antiSMASH tool
  - See `the example <https://docs.antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/understanding_output/>`_

Genome Browser
--------------

With aid of `JBrowse <http://jbrowse.org/>`_, Bacannot already give users a totally customised and redered Genome Browser for exploration of genome annotation.

.. image:: images/jbrowse.png
  :width: 800
  :align: center

In order to provide an integrative solution, the genome browser is already packed inside the shiny app that can be used with the ``run_server.sh`` script or the server docker image (See below at Bacannot shiny parser).

.. warning::

  The JBrowse wrapper in the shiny server is not capable of displaying the GC content and methylation plots when available. It can only display the simpler tracks. If the user wants to visualise and interrogate the GC or methylation tracks it must open the JBrowse outside from the shiny server. For that, two options are available:
    * You can navigate to the ``jbrowse`` directory under your sample's output folder and simply execute `http-server`. This command can be found at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
    * Or, you can download the `JBrowse Desktop app <https://jbrowse.org/docs/jbrowse_desktop.html>`_ and, from inside the app, select the folder `jbrowse/data` that is available in your sample's output directory.


Bacannot shiny parser
---------------------

.. image:: images/bacannot_shiny.gif
  :width: 70%
  :align: center

The bacannot shiny server is basically a wrapper of the main outputs of the pipeline that is packed up in a docker image called ``fmalmeida/bacannot:server``.
This server is triggered by going under the results folder, in our quickstart case, the ``_ANNOTATION/ecoli`` folder, and executing the command:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Trigger the server
  ./run_server.sh -s

  # This will open the pipeline in localhost:3838
  # log message:
  The server has started in: http://localhost:3838/
  When finished, run the command:
	       docker rm -f ServerBacannot

  # To stop the server you just need to execute
  docker rm -f ServerBacannot

Server homepage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the first page it has indexed as url links the main HTML reports and the **JBrowse genome browser**.

Server sqlDB parser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the second page, the sqlDB is used to provide a rapid and simple way to query and filter the genome annotation.

.. note::

  The sqlDB parser contains a set of features that enables that the users filter the annotation following their desires. It is possible
  to filter based on the ``contigs``, ``sources``, ``start``, ``end``, ``strand`` and more.

  Additionally, the parser accepts as input a file of patterns to filter the annotation based on the values available in the attributes
  column of the GFF (9th column). Any value available in this column can be used as filters, the only requirement is to write each pattern
  in one line, exactly as it is found in the annotation result. For example, it can be used to select only a few genes based on their IDs.

Server BLAST (for intersection) app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the third page, the server provides a simple way to BLAST the genome with new gene queries and to automatically identify intersections
between the blast results and the the main annotation.

  :align: center

Server BLAST (SequenceServer) app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the last page, the server provides an implementation of SequenceServer which allows users to BLAST their samples and visualise the alignments produced.
